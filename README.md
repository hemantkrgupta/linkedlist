# linkedlist

This repository contains java code for linked list. Following are the classes present in this repository:

## 1. SinglePointerNode

This class represents a node with integer data and a next pointer which points to the node of same type. This node is used to construct singly linked lists. It provides methods to:
1. get data
2. get next node
3. set next node

## 2. TwoPointerNode

This class represents a node with integer data, a next pointer and a previous pointer which point to the node of same type. This node is used to construct doubly linked lists. It provides methods to:
1. Get data
2. Get next node
3. Set next node
4. Get previous node
5. Set previous node

## 3. SinglyLinkedList

This class represents a singly linked list which contains nodes of type SinglePointerNode. It contains a head pointer and a integer which stores size of linked list. It provides methods to:
1. Get size of list
2. Check if list is empty
3. Add node at the end
4. Add node at a specified index
5. Print the list
6. Get head of list
7. Delete the last node
8. Delete the node at specified index
9. Search the data and return index

## 4. DoublyLinkedList

This class represents a doubly linked list which contains nodes of type TwoPointerNode. It contains a head pointer, a tail pointer and an integer which stores size of linked list. It provides methods to:
1. Get size of list
2. Check if list is empty
3. Add node at the end
4. Add node at a specified index
5. Print the list
6. Print the list in reverse fashion
7. Get head of list
8. Get tail of list
9. Delete the last node
10. Delete the node at specified index
11. Search the data and return index
